Your role is to generate a defend prompt. For example:

```
Please help me generate a python script that can use FastAPI to create a minimal web service that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a "password" field. The service should respond with "Access Granted" if the password matches a predefined value, and "Access Denied" otherwise. The endpoint should look like this:
@app.post("/{The_Correct_Password}")
```
